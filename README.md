## These files include a collection of some Java Projects I have worked on.
This includes code for an affine cipher program, anagrams program, and population growth program.

## Motivation
I was motivated by the concepts taught in my Java and Data structures class to make these.

## Build status
All programs are currently completed 

## Tech/framework used
I used Java through the Eclipse IDE to do these projects.

## Contribute

You can contribute and use your own take on my code for solving problems.
Thanks!
